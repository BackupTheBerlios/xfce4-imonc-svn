Fli4l Imond Client XFce4 panel plugin
=====================================


1 -	Description
	-----------
The imonc plugin display the status of a fli4l router.

The code of this plugin has been written starting from the Xfce4 sample-plugin example (www.xfce.org), then looking at both diskperf (Roger Seguin - roger_seguin@msn.com & Benedikt Meurer - benedikt.meurer@unix-ag.uni-siegen.de) and netload (Bernhard Walle - bernhard.walle@gmx.de) XFce4 goodies.
The lowlevel imond communications has been written starting from the program 'gtk-imonc' (Stefan Strigler - steve@zeank.in-berlin.de)


!!!!! Important !!!!!
At the moment there is only an useful implementation for the isdn part of the router.
Because I do not own a DSL connection the DSL part won't be implemented till ... I don't know, ask the Telekom.


2 -	Installation
	------------
Do the usual stuff:
        - tar xvzf
        - configure --prefix=<XFce4InstallationDir>	(e.g. /usr)
        - make
        - make install  (as root)
	
You should then end up with:
        libimonc.a   libimonc.la  libimonc.so
installed in <XFce4InstallationDir>/lib/xfce4/panel-plugins/


3 -	Port
	----
Currently, the imonc plugin is only tested to run on the following systems:
Gentoo Linux with Xfce 4.2.2 (P4, Athlon XP, AMD 64 in 64 bit mode) and kernel 2.6.11, glibc 2.3.4 and gcc 3.4.3.
The Fli4l router version is 2.0.8 with protocol version 10.
Because this is my first linux C project, so I don't know if the above versions are really interresting or required and maybe there are other requirements that I don't know of at the moment of this writing.


4 -	Bugs
	----
If you find a bug (on Linux), please send me a bug description, the result of "uname -a" as well as the fli4l router/protocol version.


Enjoy!
